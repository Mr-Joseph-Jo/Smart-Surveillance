Real-Time Video Surveillance & Behavior Analysis!This project is an advanced video surveillance system designed to provide intelligent, real-time analysis of human behavior from camera feeds. Using pose estimation and motion tracking, it automatically detects anomalous activities, tracks individuals, and provides valuable data insights for security and operational staff.üéØ Core Functionalities1Ô∏è‚É£ Anomalous Behavior DetectionDescription: Detects abnormal or suspicious human behavior in real time using pose estimation and simple pose/motion rules.Examples:Fall Detection: Identifies when a person has fallen down.Loitering Detection: Flags individuals lingering in an area for an unusual amount of time.Intrusion Detection: Alerts when a person enters a monitored area during restricted hours.2Ô∏è‚É£ Individual Person Selection & Trail MarkingDescription: Allows security staff to select any detected person (via bounding box or ID) to analyze their movement.Features:Marks and displays the selected person‚Äôs full trail/path over time.Shows entry/exit points, zones visited, and corresponding timestamps for forensic analysis.3Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Camera Tracking (Optional / Advanced)Description: Attempts to re-identify and track the same person across multiple, potentially overlapping, camera feeds.Goal: Maintain a consistent ID for an individual as they move between different camera views to provide a seamless tracking experience.4Ô∏è‚É£ People CountingDescription: Counts the number of people present in each camera feed or within a defined area in real time.Applications:Crowd monitoring in public spaces.Occupancy analysis for capacity management.5Ô∏è‚É£ Heatmaps for Zone AnalysisDescription: Generates visual heatmaps to illustrate areas with the highest foot traffic and dwell time.Benefits:Helps security teams identify potential hotspots or loitering areas.Provides insights into unusual crowding patterns.6Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Restricted Zone ViolationDescription: Enables the creation of virtual zones or restricted perimeters on the camera feed.Alerting:Automatically detects and counts how many people enter these restricted zones.Raises immediate alerts for any unauthorized entry.üõ†Ô∏è Installation# Clone the repository
