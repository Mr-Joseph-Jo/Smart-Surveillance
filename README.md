# üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Smart-Surveillance: Intelligent Object Tracking System

An intelligent surveillance system built with Python, designed for automated object tracking and event detection in video streams. It leverages computer vision techniques to monitor designated areas efficiently.

## ‚ú® Features

Our Smart-Surveillance system offers a range of powerful features to enhance your monitoring capabilities:

*   ‚ú® **Real-time Object Tracking:** Accurately identifies and follows objects within live or recorded video feeds, providing continuous monitoring.
*   üöÄ **Automated Event Detection:** Triggers alerts or actions based on predefined events or anomalies detected in the surveillance area.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Customizable Surveillance Zones:** Define specific regions of interest for focused monitoring, reducing false positives and optimizing resource usage.
*   üíæ **Flexible Video Input:** Supports processing from various video sources, including local video files and potentially camera streams.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Lightweight & Efficient:** Designed for optimal performance with minimal resource consumption, making it suitable for diverse environments.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get Smart-Surveillance up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the Smart-Surveillance repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Smart-Surveillance/Smart-Surveillance.git
cd Smart-Surveillance
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is assumed for a Python project. If not present, common dependencies like `opencv-python` and `numpy` would be installed individually.)*

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once installed, you can run the `select_track_two.py` script to perform smart surveillance on a video file.

### Basic Usage

To process a video file, use the following command:

```bash
python select_track_two.py --video test_video.mp4
```

This command will initialize the surveillance system and process the `test_video.mp4` file, likely displaying the tracked objects in a new window.

### Configuration Options

Currently, the primary configuration is through command-line arguments. Future versions may include a dedicated configuration file.

| Option    | Description                                   | Default | Example Usage                       |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------ | :---------------------------------- |
| `--video` | Path to the input video file.                 | None    | `--video my_footage.avi`            |
| `--mode`  | (Placeholder) Operation mode (e.g., 'detect') | 'track' | `--mode detect`                     |

## üõ£Ô∏è Project Roadmap

We have exciting plans for the future of Smart-Surveillance:

*   **Version 1.1 - Enhanced Detection:** Implement advanced machine learning models for more accurate and diverse object detection (e.g., specific object types, human posture).
*   **Version 1.2 - Real-time Camera Integration:** Add support for direct integration with IP cameras and webcams for live surveillance streams.
*   **Version 1.3 - User Interface (UI):** Develop a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for easier configuration, visualization, and event management.
*   **Future - Cloud Integration:** Explore options for cloud-based storage of event data and integration with notification services.
*   **Future - Performance Optimization:** Continuous improvements to enhance processing speed and reduce latency for high-resolution video.


## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the Smart-Surveillance project! To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines:

### Code Style

*   Adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.
*   Use clear and concise variable names.
*   Include comments for complex logic.

### Branch Naming Conventions

*   **`main`**: The stable, production-ready branch.
*   **`develop`**: The integration branch for new features.
*   **`feature/<feature-name>`**: For new features (e.g., `feature/camera-integration`).
*   **`bugfix/<bug-description>`**: For bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/tracking-issue`).
*   **`hotfix/<issue-name>`**: For urgent fixes to `main`.

### Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repository and create your feature/bugfix branch from `develop`.
2.  Ensure your code is well-tested and follows the code style.
3.  Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the `develop` branch.
4.  Provide a clear description of your changes in the PR.
5.  Address any feedback or review comments promptly.

### Testing Requirements

*   All new features should ideally be accompanied by unit tests.
*   Ensure existing tests pass before submitting a PR.
*   If applicable, provide steps to manually test your changes.
